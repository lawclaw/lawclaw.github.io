   <p>Uganda or the Republic of Uganda is located in East Africa. The country is inhabited by 41 million citizens  with different ethnicities and languages. The country has been developing since its independence in 1962. However, many internal conflicts have slowed the development down and the country today is struggling with poverty and weak economy. </p>

      <p> Uganda is one of the developing countries that’s been suffering from both economic and political issues which has affected the education system. A new education system has been introduced in 1997 known as UPE (Universal Primary Enrollment) which was chosen by the public as a way to offer free education. When the system was initially introduced it offered free education to four children per family. This new system was not performing based on regulations and most Ugandan families had more than 4 children which caused a rapid increase in the enrollment of students in primary schools.
      </p>
      <p> Due to these circumstances president Museveni had to announce that the UPE system was open to all children of all families and this would cause schools to experience a rapid influx of students.  </p>
      <p> When the policy was finally executed the schools had far too many students and required more school supplies, classrooms and teachers which became a challenge for the educational system to provide due to the economic instability and lack of trained teachers.</p>
    <center><h3> Comparison to Vietnam</h3></center>
      <p> Uganda’s education compared to Vietnam’s is quite underdeveloped as the Vietnamese government nearly spend 6% of their GDP on education. Uganda on the other hand only spends 2,2% of its GDP. 
    <br> <br> Since 2015, 87% is literate in Uganda. Vietnam has its corresponding 98,1% literacy. <br> <br> While Uganda’s education is not to be compared to Vietnam’s education due to the budget that they have, education is mostly free in Uganda that lacks professionalism and proper education tools. Unlike Uganda, Vietnam has access to many of these tools and has a better quality of education. This comes with the cost of education not being free. 37% of Vietnamese 15-year olds are not in school and it’s quite a challenge to get them enrolled. Even though the country has been receiving high results on tests like PISA, the numbers don’t show the percentage that are not in school.<br> <br>The main issue in Vietnam is due to the pressure by society and the curriculum to succeed get the highest grades, the students happiness level has been decreasing and suicide amongst them have been increasing. </p>

      <p> Uganda is a republic with a high influential presidential power. There are multiple parties after the change of constitution in 2005, but the President Yoweri Museveni practically has all the power. Museveni took the power with a coup d’état in 1986 with his party the National Resistance Army.
      </p>
      <p> The discontent in the country has increased during later years and the opposition have struggled by not only the government’s oppression but also through its lack of organization. Museveni uses violence to secure his position and because of that his position has been questioned by many. </p>
    <center><h3> Comparison to Somalia</h3></center>
      <p> Somalia is a country where violence and anarchy has been a problem since 1991. Uganda is more totalitarian where the government has control of so many aspects that it infringes the privacy of the individual. Somalia on the other hand has a lack of organization which has led to the anarchy in the country. The country lacks a functioning government, police force and court system due to corruption, pirates and terrorist groups. <br> <br> The main issue in both countries is that their social structure is tribalism. Tribalism is how society is divided based on tribes. Tribalism influences a lot of aspects of life for the people living in these countries. This can be seen in the work environment, schools and social life. The leaders of the tribes are the ones responsible for making decisions, such as who the tribe members will marry and other matters involving outside tribes. </p>

In fact when I went to Uganda for the first time one of the things that occurred to me was that I saw very few elderly people.
